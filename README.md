### 🤖 My Philosophy: Humans, Augmented by AI

I believe that the future of technology is not about replacing human expertise, but augmenting it with intelligent automation. My work focuses on building systems where **AI agents act as powerful collaborators**, handling repetitive tasks and providing data-driven insights, while **human experts remain in control** of strategy, critical decision-making, and creative problem-solving. This human-centric approach to AI ensures that we build more resilient, efficient, and innovative solutions.

This portfolio showcases practical, real-world examples of this philosophy in action.
